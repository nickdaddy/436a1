Installation
Prereq: Golang must be installed on the OS running this application. Your $GOPATH must be set and the root directory of this application must be placed into your $GOPATH/src

I've supplied binaries that have been compiled on OSX10, but if you'd like to recompile on a different OS, place the entire directory into your $GOPATH/src.
and run the shell script buildA1.sh inside. Doing so will place clientA1 and serverA1 binaries in your $GOPATH/bin. If your $PATH variable contains $GOPATH/bin you may invoke with clientA1 or serverA1 from any directory, otherwise go to $GOPATH/bin and invoke with ./clientA1 or ./serverA1

serverA1 should be invoked with the port number you wish for
clientA1 should be invoked with the privateIP:portnumber

ex
serverA1 33333
clientA1 00.00.0.000:33333
