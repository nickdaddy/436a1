Testing:
The program has been tested with multiple clients in a real time environment. Clients tested all commands: create, leave, delete, join, and communicated to each other in chat rooms that they were in.

Deleting rooms due to inactivity was tested by decreasing the timeframe to 10 seconds. Right now they are deleted at 100 Seconds just to prove it works, instead of the 7 days as it should.

The programs have been tested on mac and linux and run fine on both. It should run on windows as well but must be compiled as described in the manual.
